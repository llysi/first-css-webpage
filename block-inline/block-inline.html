    <h2>Inline, Block, and Inline-Block</h2>

    <p>This is a paragraph with a <span class="inline">span element</span> that behaves like an inline element. Another <span class="inline2">span element</span> follows in the same line.</p>

    <div>
    This is a block element. It takes up the full width of the page and pushes content down.
    </div>

    <p>Here's another paragraph for reference. The block element above should have pushed it down.</p>

    <section>
    This is the first inline-block element. It sits in a line but behaves like a block.
    </section>

    <section>
    This is the second inline-block element. It also sits in line and has a fixed size.
    </section>
